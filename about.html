            Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
            to making science accessible to all. The aim of our museum is to
            create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
            discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue
            the exploration of the world around us. We believe science should
            not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through
            exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the
            many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits
            are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science
            come to life

          <p>
            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
            down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do.
          </p>

            You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why
            not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
            exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make
            sure you come ready to learn and explore.

            We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
            Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
            experiment with our team of experts.

          <p>
            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
            can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
            Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore.

            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more
            about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students
            through for a visit.
